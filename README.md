# ML-Task-6

assginment-4 : The aim of this challenge is to implement a linear regression with regularization via gradient descent. the dataset contains information collected by the US census services concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. the output includes three files to contrast the difference between performance of linear regression Lp norm and L2 norm for 3 different values.

assignment-5-6-7: The aim of this challenge is to implement linear regression model and find the R2 score to find whether the model is good or bad.

assignment-8 : The challenge is to implement the linear regresion model with certain labels and find whether the model has a good accuracy. The dataset consist of data about the retail price of 2005 General Motors cars.
